# Let's code a Linux Driver!

This repository is just my execution of the original "Let's code a Linux driver", which is available in [Johannes4Linux' repository](https://github.com/Johannes4Linux/Linux_Driver_Tutorial).

Each directory is a chapter and inside you can find the code files involved, along with a Makefile to build them and a README.md file with annotations and instructions to test and evaluate the results of the kernel modules.
